title: 'Grokking Algorithms â€” 2nd edition'
review: >
  This book offers a deep dive into essential data structures (e.g., hashmaps, queues, binary trees) 
  and algorithms (e.g., quick sort, selection sort, binary search). While I felt the binary search 
  chapter was a bit premature without foundational concepts like linear search, I found the book 
  excels with its clear, practical code examples. Overall, I think it's a highly informative and 
  well-structured resource.
